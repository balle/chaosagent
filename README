////[ About

Chaosagent is a tool for automating (and filtering) searches with Yahoo, 
converting search results to RSS feed, collecting a list of RSS feeds, 
filter them for regexp and generate a new feed or for just looking up the 
weather outside.
Chaosagent can present results in text and speech mode (using festival). 
It can read search results and if you like download all found urls and 
dump them to your disk.
